# project1-assesment
realized after writing js for a majority of the allotted time that i got too focused on making the new input value appear that i wasn't thinking about making it actually do any addition, so when you write a new input and press the plus button it only appends itself. but it works great as an input value appender! spent the rest of my time wrestling with css but had to scrap it since it just wasn't working and had to make time for myself to trouble shoot some gh-pages problems since i didnt have time to start over
